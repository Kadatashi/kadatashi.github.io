[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) mission is to understand and analyze a real phenomena from data. To carry this out, the main fields that a Data Scientist should master are: mathematics & statistics, computer science and domain knowledge.

Wow, sounds cool! But... what university degree should I study to became a Data Scientist? Well, there is not a unique answer. At this point, I want to remark that before you start a degree, you need to like the job positions you can apply through that studies. So I find interesting to explain the difference between the most popular data-related jobs: 

* Data Analyst / Bussines Intelligence Analyst
* Data Engineer / Bussines Intelligence 
* Data Scientist
