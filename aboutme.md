My name is Patricia G.,
I am from Spain, where I was born, but that is not important. I could be described just as a person who found a little passion in Data Science world and realize that, when you come from non pure statistical/computational/mathematical you may find difficult to know what path follow in order to go in-depth in this area. So the aim of this project is merely to provide a very clear guide and key concepts explanation about how to reach such objective.

I also would like to thank everyone everyone for being interested in DS, I am strongly convinced that AI is the future to make people's life easier. Use this powerful tool carefully. â™¥
